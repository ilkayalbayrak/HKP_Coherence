when a node hits mole-num==0

Problem Scoretable MM hits 0, but when I find all the nodes with label w from the tree, sum of their mole_nums is
not 0

In some cases an item (or multiple I have seen max 2) is suppressed or rather is in the suppressed items list, however, it still exists in score-table
This event should not happen, if an item is suppressed it should absolutely be removed from the  score-table

on delete subtree, eventually there comes a point the parent of the node we pass to the function raises the error:
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'label' (after longer inspection node.parent is not an instance of Node which is wrong, it should be a node in every case)
    ThIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE ALL NODES HAVE THE LABEL ATTRIBUTE
        When infinite loop happens because of the items that cant be deleted from scoretable for some reason
        there is NO Attribute error issue

        The MAIN ISSUE: Parent of the "current node" is none, because at some point it was a parent of another node and
                        at that time while dealing with ancestor nodes its mole_num reached 0, then we cut it from the
                        tree, therefore the parent of our current node is NONE, because it was cut oof from the tree

When we reduce the mole_num of the ancestor nodes, mole_num reaches 0 before

!!! if root is the only ancestor, maybe we need to cut the current node from the tree !!!

score table MM, goes below zero in some cases, it probably means that we are miscalculating the mole_nums




[] CALCULATE DATA DISTORTION
when generating C, F needs to go down and M needs to go up but M stays zero while
F len increases

[] mole_num != MM, in some cases, normally they should be equal but sometimes MM > mole_num
[] in ancestor seaarch part, firstly check if w.label exists in scoretable, because it may have been popped from ST
    but w.label can still exist as a node in the tree, hence it could be an ancestor. So when we say ST[w.label][MM]
    we may accidentally cause a keyError
