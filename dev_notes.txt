[x] Identify and suppress minimal nodes
[x] Figure out how to follow the information loss, Assume IL(e)=1 for now
[x] Add sigma parameter to decide percentage of private items among all unique items


# prepare runtime plots for p, k and sigma
# prepare distortion plots for p,k and sigma

# distortion should be average of 5 random selections for sigma|U| public items
# Finding moles while using a low k value like k==5 takes too much time
