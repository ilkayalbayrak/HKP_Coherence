# p: we measure the “power” of the attacker by the

"""
    A database D has "(h,k,p)-coherence" if, for every such combination β of no more than p
    public items, either no transaction contains β, or the set of
    transactions containing β, called β-cohort, contains at least k
    transactions and no more than h percent of these transactions
    contains a common private item.

    U: universe, public + private items
    
    D: database
    
    p: maximum number p of public items that can be obtained as prior
        knowledge in a single attack, and measure the level of protection
        relative to that power of attackers
        
    beta: combination of puclic items no more than "p"
    
    beta_cohort: set of transactions containing "beta". β-cohort requires its transactions to contain all the
                items in β, but not necessarily contain items not in β
                
    Sup(beta): Sup(β), the support of β, denotes the number of transactions in β-cohort.
    
    k,h: "beta_cohort" contains at least "k" transactions and no more than "h" percent of these transactions
        contains a common private item.
        
    **The probability that a transaction contains e, given that it contains β, is
            P(β→e)=Sup(β∪{e})/Sup(β).
            
    P_breach(beta): is the breach probability of beta, to be the maximmum P(beta->e) for any private item e.
                    (we consider only a single private item e in an attack β→e.)
        
 
    In other words, (h,k,p)-coherence ensures that, for an attacker with the power p, the
    probability of linking an individual to a transaction is limited to
    1/k and the probability of linking an individual to a private item is
    limited to h.
    
    equivalence_class: A group of records that are indistinguishable from each other is often 
                        referred to as an equivalence class.
    
                        After anonymization, quasi-identifier values of several records are equal, 
                        thus form- ing an equivalence class. In this way, an individual would not be 
                        easily identified because the attacker obtains only the equivalence class without 
                        additional knowledge [2].
        
    
    information_loss: We measure "information loss" by the amount of items suppressed.
                    the total information loss in the transformation, where ∑ is over
                    all the items e suppressed.
                        
    
    item_suppression: by suppressing an item from D, we simply delete the item fromm all transactions that
                        contain the item. 
                        EXAMPLE:
                            After suppressing the items a
                            and f from the transactions {a, b, HIV}, {a, d, f, HIV} and {b, d,
                            Diabetes}, the transactions become {b, HIV}, {d, HIV} and {b, d,
                            diabetes}.
                            
    
    
    beta is a pub itemset with len(beta) <= p and Sup(beta)>0
    
    mole: beta is called a "mole" wrt (h,k,p), if either;
        Sup(beta)<k or P_breach(beta)>h. Otherwise, beta is called "non-mole"
        D is (h,k,p)-coherent if D contains no moles
        
    Minimal Mole: A mole is called minimal, if its subsets are non-moles. Example ab is a minimal mole if subsets a and b are non-moles.
                            
    MM(e): denotes the number of minimal moles containing the public item e
    
    Mi: denotes the set of all minimal moles of size i
    
    Fi: denotes the set of all extendible non-moles
    
    Extendible non-mole: A non-mole is said to be extendible if it contains no mole.
    
    M*: denotes the set of all minimal moles of size (2 <= i <= p)
    
    ########- ITEM SUPPRESSION/INFORMATION LOSS -########
    We will modify D until its hkp-coherent.
    
    
    ########- PROBLEM -########
    Making the database D hkp-coherent is an optimization problem because one version of D' may lead to a lower 
    information_loss than the other versions of D', D'' etc.
    
    We will assume D has a hkp-cohesion and use a greedy algorithm
